"""Cheroot thread pool watchdog for mokuro-bunko.

Monitors cheroot's worker thread pool and replaces dead threads.

Cheroot has a known issue where worker threads can die from unhandled
exceptions in socket cleanup code (especially on Windows, where errors like
WinError 10022 occur during socket.shutdown). Once a thread dies, cheroot
does not replace it. If enough threads die, the server stops processing
requests and returns 503 Service Unavailable.

This watchdog periodically checks the thread pool and replaces dead threads,
keeping the server alive despite the cheroot bug.
